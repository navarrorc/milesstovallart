      Miles deﬁnes his philosophy of life
as creating balance and well-being.
He believes it is important to never
forget who you truly are in this
world! Miles integrates his creative,
physical, mental, and social
attributes into his daily life. He
absolutely has a passion for all that
he does and if he ﬁnds himself
straying from any of his core principles
that guide him, he quickly takes a step
back and remembers the foundation that
deﬁnes who he is as a person.

      As a professional artist, Miles has had numerous
art shows and he continues to paint and sell his
work so others can enjoy the beauty he expresses
on canvas. Living in Germany during his high
school years, Miles was afforded the opportunity
to absorb culture in a different light by studying
art through the eyes of a European perspective.
Miles credits this experience as one that helped
to enlighten and enhance his gift of painting.

      There is no subject matter
that Miles is incapable of
painting on canvas, however his
strengths are deﬁnitely due to
his play with light and color in
both his still life and botanical
paintings. Miles is also a
master gardener and he
incorporates his own garden
into his work.
